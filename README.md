# MIPS-Assembly-Recursion-MIPS-Datapath-and-Pipeline
An assembly program in MIPS implementing a recursive algorithm that calculates a power of three (3^n , 10 â‰¤ n &lt; 20)

The input number (your chosen power of 3) will be given to the program as an input from the keyboard and the final result will be printed on the screen.
